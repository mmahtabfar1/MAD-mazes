# MAD-mazes
Final Project for Data Structures and Algorithms

### Dependencies and Building
This project has python module dependencies which can be installed from PyPI, as well as extension modules which need to be installed in a virutal enviornment.


First create and activate the virtual enviornment:

```$ python3 -m venv venv```

```$ source ./venv/bin/activate```

Install dependencies via PyPI:

```$ pip install -r requirements.txt```

Finally build and install the extension modules in the virtual enviornment:

```$ python setup.py build```

Now you can run the program!
```$ python main.py```
